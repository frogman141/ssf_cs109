# Welcome to SoftStack Factory Labs cs109 Repo

The repo contains all of the homework sets, labs, and lecutures utilized in Harvard's cs109 Data Science Course.

**Course url:** http://cs109.github.io/2015/index.html

## CS109 Overview:
CS109 is a Data Science course meant to expose an individual to all of the different aspects of data science project. Cover various topics ranging from how to conduct an exploratory data analysis, build a model, and tell a data driven story. This course covers a lot of different targets as such the goal is not understand all of the materials being covered. Merely to be exposed to it and then review everything discussed at a later date in greater detail.

## How to work through he course material:
The course is broken down into weeks.  For every week there are 2 lectures and a lab. Starting from week one and work your way down.
Try to listen to the lecture twice and derive some basic notes from the lectures.
For every two weeks worth of lectures and labs you complete complete a homework assignment. Start from homework 1 and work through the rest.
After you have completed all of the homework you now need to work on the courses final project. Please read the project page of CS109 for further details related to the project.

## Final Project:
After completing all of the course material you'll need to work on a 2 week-long data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results. 

If you want to you can form a team with another individual that has completed this final project.

**Project Milestone:**
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Modeling
- Visualizations
- A website explaining your findings

## Books Required:
In addition to the course material spend there are four books that I would recommend reading. The last two I would recommend after the course is completed.
1. **Python for Data Analysis** 2nd Edition
2. **Practical Statistics for Data Science**
3. **Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn and Tensorflow**
4. **Data Science for Business**
5. **Machine Learning for Hackers**
