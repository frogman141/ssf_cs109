# Lecture 5: Statistical Modeling 

### What is a Statistical Model?
- A statistical model is a family of distributions that are indexed by parameters. They're primary uses are for statistical inference and probability purposes:
    - Statistical Inference is all about estimating the parameters of a model that represents a pariticular dataset. For example calculating the mean or finding the median are forms of statistical inference.
    - Probability is about utilizing the estimated parameters of a model to predict something about future data. 

- There are two major types of statistical models:
    - **Parameteric Models:** models that have a finite parameter space (i.e. normal distributions). Examples of finite parameters would be the mean or median.
    - **Non-Parameteric Models:** models that have a infinite parameter space (i.e. bootstrap).

### Most Common Parameteric Models:

- **Normal Distribution:** (This is the most important distribution in all of the statistics)
    - The Normal Distribution is the ionic bell-shaped distribution everyone knows about. This distribution is iconic because sample statistics distributions often follow a normal distribution.
        - The normal distribution is symmetrical 
        - It follows the central limit theorem.
    - The **Standard Normal Distribution** is one in which the units on the x-axis are expressed as in terms of the standard deviations away from the mean. 
    - To compare data in the standard normal distribution you subtract the mean then divide by the standard deviation which results in the **z-score**. The process of Calculating the z-score is called **Normalization** or **Standardization**.
    - One of the most promient methods of determining whether a dataset follows a normal distribution is to generate a QQ-plot. A QQ-plot is generated by ordering the z-scores from low to high and plot them along both the Y and X axis.
        - Since were plotting the z-scores the units correspond to the standard deviation. 
    - If the points roughly fall on a diagonal line, then the sample distribution is considered to be a normal distribution.
    - Normal Distribution Magic:
        - the magic of statistics is that your population distribution of of sample averages you'll observe a normal distribution. 
        - Additionally, the estimators of multiple systems will typically converage and form a normal distribution.
            1. Center: the sampling distribution
    - **Summary:**
        - The normal distribution is utilized to mathetmatically approximation of uncertainty and variability 
        - Raw data typically doesn't come in Normal Distribution, but averages of populations and samples typically are 
        normal distribution.
        - Converting data to z-scores, you subtract the mean of the data and divide by the standard deviation; you can then compare the data to a normal distribution.

- **Possion Distribution:**
    - The Possion Distribution is a discrete probability distribution model.
    - This distribution is extremely useful for modeling queueing questions.
    - For the Possion Distributions mean is equal to variance
    - **Summary:** The Possion Distribution tells us the distribution of events per unit of time/space to another when we sample many such units.

- **Exponential Distribution:**
    - Exponential Distribution is utilized to model the frequency distribution of the time or distance from one event to the next event.
        - Exponential Distribution is really useful for modeling the time between events.
    - One of the most useful features of the exponential distribution is it's memoryless property:
    - The memoryless property is when the likelihood of something happening in the future has no relation to whether or not it has happened in the past.
        - The history of the function is irrelevant to the future.
    - **Summary:** The Exponential Distributions role is to model the time or distance between one event and the next event.

- **Weibull Distribution:**
    - The Weibull Distribution is an extension of the Exponential Distribution, in which the event rate is allowed to change as specified. Where as the event rate increases the probability of an event occurring increases to 1. 
    - Due to this property of the Weibull Distribution it's typically utilized for the time-to-failure analysis:
        - Life Expectancy 
        - mechanical failures
    - **Summary:** Weibull Distribution is utilized for modeling a changing event rate over time (e.g. an increasing probability of device failure).

### Sampling Techniques:

- **Bootstrap:**
    - Bootstrap is a resampling technique out of our dataset with replacement is a powerfule tool for assessing the variablility of sample statistics.
    by utilizing the resample without replacement we can calculate the empircal distribution of an estimator to approxiamte the populations distribution.
    - Bootstrapping works because of the law of large numbers. As the number of records in a sample set increases bootstraps converges towards the true distribution of the population.
    - Bootstrap can be applied in similar fashion in a wide variatey of circumstances because it's non-parametric. Therefore, we do not need to mathematically approximatate the sampling distribution.
    - When bootstarp is applied to the data of predicitive models, the aggregating of multiple bootstrap predictions outperforms the use of a single model.
     - **Key Feature of BootStap:** BootStrap does not compensate for a small sample size; for it does not create new data nor does it fill in holes in the existing
    data. It merely informs us about how lots of about how lots of additional samples would behave when drawn from a population like our original sample.
