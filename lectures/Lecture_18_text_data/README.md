# Lecture 18: Finishing Bayesian Statistics and Text Data
In this lecture we will finish our exploration of bayesian statistics on hierarchial bayesian models and the Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm. After finishing bayesian statistics you'll learn the basics of mining text data through discussing n-grams and topic modeling.
