# Lecture 3 - Exploratory Data Anaylsis

```
The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.

## Overview
The role of a Data Scientist is to develop solutions to business problems with data. Before you can develop any data driven solution though you need to understand your data. Does the avaliable data cover the problem space? Do we have sufficient number of records coverage? What kind of models can we develop with our model? What is your understanding of the data? All of these questions and more are answered via Exploratory Data Analyis (EDA). The purpose of EDA is to identify patterns and trends in your data. Visualizations is the best way to discover these patterns and trends.
