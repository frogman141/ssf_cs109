# Lecture 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

- How should you explore your data?
    - Before you begin to explore your data develop an initial set of questions you ask about the data. Thereby, providing your exploration with initial direction. 
    - As you answer your initial set of questions you should try to generate new questions from what you have learned about your data.
    - Be vigilent and remember the data will always surprise you.

    "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never noticed before."

- Visualizations are a invaluable tools for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) use them!  
    - visualziation allows us to convery information in manner that reduces the conginative loading on the reciepient
    - Thereby making it easier to understand the data one is working with or sharing

- Whenever your exploring a dataset try to generate as many different possible ways of visualizing your data. Different visualizations will reveal different patterns. 
    - A good starting point is to develop 6 different visualizations when visualizing a dataset.

- There are 2 primary goals of any Visualization:
    - Communicate (exploratory)
        - Present data and ideas
        - explore and inform
        - provide evidence and support
        - influence persuade
    - Analyze
        - Explore the data
        - Assess the situation
        - Determine how to proceed
        - Decide what to do

- Principles of Effective Visualizations:
    1. Have graphical integrity (make sure your axis's start at 0!)
    2. Keep it simple
    3. Use the right display
    4. use colors strategically
    5. Tell a story with your data (More on that in lecture 6)

- Maintaining Graphical Integrity:
    - primary way of losing graphical integrity is distortions. There are 2 types of graphical distortions: scaling and axis distortions.
        - scaling distortions is when you do not properly indicate the scale of the graph.
        - axis distorition is when you do not start an axis at 0.

- When developing visualizations. **KEEP IT SIMPLE!**
    - do not use fancy 3d graphs. Especially if there static
    - remove all unnecessary background features from the graph. These will distract you and your audience!

- When developing a visualization make sure you understand the perceptual effictiveness of graphical features:
    - Most effective
        - position
        - Length
        - Slope or Angle
        - Area
        - Intensing
        - Color or Shape
    - Least Effective

    - For what data should you use these graphical features?
        - Quantitative Data:
            - position
            - Length
            - Slope or Angle
        - Ordered Data:
            - Area
            - Intensing
        - Categorical Data:
            - Color or Shape



- **Summary:**
    - Understanding your data is absolutely crucial aspect of any data science project. In order to understand your day you need to explore it effectively. Through developing and continously asking and anwsering a series of questions about the data. These questions should enable you to explore/identify patterns in the data. For exploring these patterns you should visualizations as it's a great way to see the patterns hidden within a dataset.
