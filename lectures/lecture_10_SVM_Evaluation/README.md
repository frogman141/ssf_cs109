# Lecture 10: Support Vector Machine, Performance Evaluation, and Hyperparameter Tuning

This lecture goes into a indepth explanantion of what support vector machines are and how they are trained. Additionally, this lecture will briefly discuss hyperparamters and how to tune them. Finally, topic that is discussed is how to evaulate model performance.
